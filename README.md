# Racket Puzzle Solving

## Preview
&emsp; The Racket language is a functional programming language and a dialect of Scheme. Lists are the primary data structure for Scheme with Racket adding new syntax structures. For this project, I used Racket to compute the solutions to the 8-puzzle game. This program contains three parts, each of which works to solve the 8-puzzle. To use this program you can create your test cases, or use the ones provided in this repository.
